# graph-processing-c++

This project is divided into two phases.

**Phase-I**
In this phase of the project, you have to create an application for graph processing which 
should have following features:
1. Read the PPI-1 data (you can reduce its size)
2. Count the number of nodes in the graph.
3. Store the graph in an adjacency matrix. 
4. Add following features/function to your application:
-Give a node show its degree.
-Find the node with maximum degree.
-Find the node with minimum degree.
-Display the raw adjacency matrix.
-Give a node find all its neighbours.
Develop your assignment using GUI/SDL 
Visually draw the graph with just nodes, put nodes on the screen in a circular way. Sample 
given as follow

**Note:** Do install and add SDL directory to visually draw the graph.

**Phase-II**
In this phase, your software should take as input a source node (i.e., its number, like 2, 44, 
or 55) and compute following:
1. Compute the MST considering the abovementioned node as the source/starting 
node
2. Find the shortest path to this source node from all other nodes.
Display the following:
3. Draw the extracted MST
4. List the distance of the source node from all other nodes
